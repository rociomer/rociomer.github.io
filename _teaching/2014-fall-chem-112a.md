CHEM 112A is an organic chemistry course for 2nd year chemistry students at UC Berkeley. Fall term 2014, the course was organized and taught by Prof. Anne Baranger. I was a graduate student instructor (GSI) for this course (twice, see first instance below).

I received an Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (OGSI) Award for this course.
