I've compiled a list of postdoctoral research fellowships which might be of interest to PhD students and postdocs in fields related to computational chemistry and artificial intelligence. I try to keep the list updated but if you spot a mistake or would like me to add anything please contact me at mercadorocio137 [at] gmail [dot] com.
