Here, we synthesized 17 novel porous covalent organic polymers with a wide range of properties, achieved by tailoring the length and geometry of the building blocks. The multifunctionalization strategy presented can be used in the design of novel catalysts, the synthesis of functional sensors, and the improvement of existing covalent organic polymers.
