excerpt: 'Here, we investigate the diffusion of CO_2 within the pores of Zn_2(dobpdc) using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to observing CO_2 diffusion through the channels parallel to the crystallographic *c* axis, we unexpectedly find that CO_2 is also able to diffuse between the hexagonal channels in the crystallographic *ab* plane, despite the walls of these channels appearing impermeable in molecular dynamics simulations. This suggests the presence of defects that enable effective multidimensional CO_2 transport in a metal–organic framework with nominally one-dimensional porosity.'

Here, we investigate the diffusion of CO_2 within the pores of Zn_2(dobpdc) using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to observing CO_2 diffusion through the channels parallel to the crystallographic *c* axis, we unexpectedly find that CO_2 is also able to diffuse between the hexagonal channels in the crystallographic *ab* plane, despite the walls of these channels appearing impermeable in molecular dynamics simulations. This suggests the presence of defects that enable effective multidimensional CO_2 transport in a metal–organic framework with nominally one-dimensional porosity.
