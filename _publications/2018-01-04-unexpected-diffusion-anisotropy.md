excerpt: 'Here, we investigate the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> within the pores of Zn<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to observing CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion through the channels parallel to the crystallographic *c* axis, we unexpectedly find that CO<sub>2</sub> is also able to diffuse between the hexagonal channels in the crystallographic *ab* plane, despite the walls of these channels appearing impermeable in molecular dynamics simulations. This suggests the presence of defects that enable effective multidimensional CO<sub>2</sub> transport in a metal–organic framework with nominally one-dimensional porosity.'

Here, we investigate the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> within the pores of Zn<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to observing CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion through the channels parallel to the crystallographic *c* axis, we unexpectedly find that CO<sub>2</sub> is also able to diffuse between the hexagonal channels in the crystallographic *ab* plane, despite the walls of these channels appearing impermeable in molecular dynamics simulations. This suggests the presence of defects that enable effective multidimensional CO<sub>2</sub> transport in a metal–organic framework with nominally one-dimensional porosity.
