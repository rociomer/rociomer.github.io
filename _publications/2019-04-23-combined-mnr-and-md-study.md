excerpt: 'In this work, we examine the diffusion of methane in MOF-74 through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations. At low gas densities, our results suggest that favorable CH<sub>4</sub>–CH<sub>4</sub> interactions lower the free energy barrier for methane hopping between open metal sites, enhancing the translational motion of methane down the *c*-axis. Furthermore, we observe that the self-diffusion coefficient of methane is inversely related to the binding energy at the open metal sites, such that diffusion is most rapid in Zn-MOF-74.'

In this work, we examine the diffusion of methane in MOF-74 through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations. At low gas densities, our results suggest that favorable CH<sub>4</sub>–CH<sub>4</sub> interactions lower the free energy barrier for methane hopping between open metal sites, enhancing the translational motion of methane down the *c*-axis. Furthermore, we observe that the self-diffusion coefficient of methane is inversely related to the binding energy at the open metal sites, such that diffusion is most rapid in Zn-MOF-74.
