excerpt: 'In this Perspective, we have collected and compared on a consistent basis the methane uptake in over 650 000 existing and predicted materials using molecular simulations. The results suggest that it may be difficult to reach the (at the time) Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) target for natural gas storage.'

In this Perspective, we have collected and compared on a consistent basis the methane uptake in over 650 000 existing and predicted materials using molecular simulations. The results suggest that it may be difficult to reach the (at the time) Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) target for natural gas storage.
