permalink: /publication/2018-08-28-generating-carbon-schwarzites
excerpt: 'Here, we develop a theoretical framework for generating zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) from any zeolite structure, and use our method to generate a library of ZTCs from all known zeolites. We establish criteria for which zeolites can produce experimentally accessible ZTCs and identify over 10 ZTCs that have not (at the time) been synthesized. We go on to establish a relationship between ZTCs and schwarzites using the triply periodic minimal surface describing the ZTC labyrinths.'

Here, we develop a theoretical framework for generating zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) from any zeolite structure, and use our method to generate a library of ZTCs from all known zeolites. We establish criteria for which zeolites can produce experimentally accessible ZTCs and identify over 10 ZTCs that have not (at the time) been synthesized. We go on to establish a relationship between ZTCs and schwarzites using the triply periodic minimal surface describing the ZTC labyrinths.
