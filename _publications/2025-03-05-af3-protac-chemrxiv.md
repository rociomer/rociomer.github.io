excerpt: 'In this study, we assess the capabilities of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for modeling ligand-mediated ternary complexes, focusing on PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). We demonstrate that when ligand information is provided, AF3 achieves high structural accuracy, even for post-2021 structures that were not included in its training set.'

In this study, we assess the capabilities of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for modeling ligand-mediated ternary complexes, focusing on PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). We demonstrate that when ligand information is provided, AF3 achieves high structural accuracy, even for post-2021 structures that were not included in its training set.
