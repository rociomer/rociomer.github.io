excerpt: 'Here, we trained and evaluated a transformer model, called Chemformer, for retrosynthesis predictions within drug discovery. The proprietary dataset used for training comprised ~18M reactions from literature, patents, and electronic lab notebooks. Chemformer was evaluated for the purpose of both single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis.'

Here, we trained and evaluated a transformer model, called Chemformer, for retrosynthesis predictions within drug discovery. The proprietary dataset used for training comprised ~18M reactions from literature, patents, and electronic lab notebooks. Chemformer was evaluated for the purpose of both single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis.
