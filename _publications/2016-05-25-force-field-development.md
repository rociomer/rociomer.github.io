excerpt: 'Here, we present accurate force fields developed from density functional theory (DFT) calculations with periodic boundary conditions for use in molecular simulations involving MOF-74 and related frameworks, where conventional force fields fail to accurately model gas adsorption due to the strongly binding open-metal sites. The introduced DFT-derived force fields predict the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>4</sub> inside these frameworks much more accurately than other common force fields.'

Here, we present accurate force fields developed from density functional theory (DFT) calculations with periodic boundary conditions for use in molecular simulations involving MOF-74 and related frameworks, where conventional force fields fail to accurately model gas adsorption due to the strongly binding open-metal sites. The introduced DFT-derived force fields predict the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>4</sub> inside these frameworks much more accurately than other common force fields.
