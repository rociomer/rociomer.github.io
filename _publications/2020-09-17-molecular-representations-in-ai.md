excerpt: 'A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. In this mini-review, we present some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in AI-driven drug discovery.'

A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. In this mini-review, we present some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in AI-driven drug discovery.
