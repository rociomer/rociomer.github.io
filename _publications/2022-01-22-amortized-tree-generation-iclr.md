Molecular design and synthesis planning are two critical steps in the process of molecular discovery that we propose to formulate as a single shared task of conditional synthetic pathway generation. Here, we report an amortized approach to generate synthetic pathways as a Markov decision process conditioned on a target molecular embedding.
