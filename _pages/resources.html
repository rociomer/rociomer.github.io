Below are various lists of largely academic resources for students and postdocs, such as research fellowships and professional development programs. If you spot an error, or there is something you would like me to add, feel free to reach me at mercadorocio137 [at] gmail [dot] com. 

Except for the postdoctoral fellowships, all the other lists of resources are (currently) heavily biased towards US-based fellowships and opportunities.
Nonetheless, I am constantly updating these pages, removing outdated links and adding interesting new resources I come across. Check back later for updates!
