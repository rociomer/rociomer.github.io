## News archive
* *08-02-2022* - I recently did a live Q&A on the artificial intelligence of drug discovery, as well as my career and what it's like to be a scientist working in my field, for Skype A Scientist LIVE. You can check out a recording of the event [here](https://youtu.be/GKOpwa-2XqQ).
* *03-02-2022* - I am co-editing a collection on "Geometric Deep Learning and the Physical Sciences" for Frontiers in AI & Big Data. You are welcome to [submit manuscripts](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/29954/geometric-deep-learning-and-the-physical-sciences) on this research topic until April 30, 2022!
* *10-11-2021* - Our paper on exploring graph traversal algorithms in graph-based molecular generation has just been accepted in JCIM. You can read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00777).
* *24-10-2021* - Check out our most recent [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06389), where we present a generative model for bottom-up synthesis planning and synthesizability-constrained molecular design! The code and data used for this work is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/wenhao-gao/SynNet). 
* *23-09-2021* - I recently presented at the Graph Machine Learning in Industry Workshop hosted by Criteo AI Lab. You can view a recording of the livestreamed talks [here](https://youtu.be/bLN1V5fZD2g) (my talk starts at ~2:41:00).
* *20-09-2021* - I am presenting recent work on deep molecular graph generation at [LatinXChem](https://www.latinxchem.org/) 2021 (all on Twitter)! You can see a high-quality version of my poster [here](https://youtu.be/Qw8nLMJ9Ptg).
* *26-07-2021* - Our MSc student Sara Romeo Atance (Chalmers, Complex Adaptive Systems '21) presented her thesis work on *de novo* molecular design at the ICML RL4RealLife Workshop. Check out our pre-print [here](https://doi.org/10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-9w3tc).
* *01-07-2021* - Our pre-print on graph traversal algorithms for graph-based deep molecular generation is now available on the ChemRxiv [here](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60dc7b3a9986aa5ca753e3a6). Check it out to see how you can use GraphINVENT to generate not only drug-like molecules, but also natural products, and why you should use BFS over DFS.
* *20-05-2021* - Our benchmarking study on chemical space coverage of deep molecular generative models has been accepted in JCIM. Read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01328).
* *17-01-2021* - I have updated the [resources](https://rociomer.github.io/resources/) tab with various lists of largely academic resources (e.g. fellowships) for students and postdocs working in STEM fields. Please share with anyone who might benefit!
* *09-12-2020* - I gave a talk at the ML4Molecules Workshop at NeurIPS 2020. You can view the talk [here](https://slideslive.com/38938184/applying-graph-neural-networks-to-molecular-design).
* *01-12-2020* - Our technical note on building molecular graph generative models has been accepted [in AAIL](https://doi.org/10.1002/ail2.18)!
* *01-12-2020* - Our paper *Graph Networks for Molecular Design* has been accepted [in MLST](https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/abcf91)! 
* *27-11-2020* - I recently presented at the 2020 GAIA (Gothenburg AI Alliance) conference! Check out the recorded conference stream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljhtfrtuNqw&feature=youtu.be).
* *16-11-2020* - We just published a new [preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Comparative_Study_of_Deep_Generative_Models_on_Chemical_Space_Coverage/13234289) on the ChemRxiv where we compare chemical space coverage, including functional group and ring system coverage, in the following deep generative models: CharRNN, REINVENT, AAE, VAE, ORGAN, LatentGAN, and GraphINVENT.
* *08-11-2020* -  Check out the [guest blog post](http://www.cheminformania.com/using-graphinvent-to-generate-novel-drd2-actives/) I wrote for Cheminformania on using GraphINVENT to generate novel DRD2 actives!
