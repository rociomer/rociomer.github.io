* *22-06-22* - Excited to share that Iâ€™ll be joining the faculty in the Data Science & AI division at Chalmers as an assistant professor starting January 2023, where I will be starting my own research group in data-driven molecular design!
* *22-04-29* - Our recent work on synthesizable molecular design was [featured](https://news.mit.edu/2022/ai-molecules-new-drugs-0426) on MIT News.
* *22-02-08* - I recently did a live Q&A on the artificial intelligence of drug discovery, as well as my career and what it's like to be a scientist working in my field, for Skype A Scientist LIVE. You can check out a recording of the event [here](https://youtu.be/GKOpwa-2XqQ).
* *22-02-03* - I am co-editing a collection on "Geometric Deep Learning and the Physical Sciences" for Frontiers in AI & Big Data. You are welcome to [submit manuscripts](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/29954/geometric-deep-learning-and-the-physical-sciences) on this research topic until April 30, 2022!
* *22-01-22* - Our conference paper on synthesizability-constrained molecular generation was accepted at ICLR 2022. Check out the paper and discussion [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=FRxhHdnxt1).
* *21-12-13* - Juan recently presented his work on a transferable Boltzmann generator for molecular conformer generation at the [ELLIS Machine Learning for Molecule Discovery Workshop](https://moleculediscovery.github.io/workshop2021/) (poster #7). Check out his paper [here](https://cloud.ml.jku.at/s/sKtfdFpoTp9F7sJ).
