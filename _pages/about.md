I am currently a postdoc in the [Coley group](https://coley.mit.edu/) at MIT. Previously, I was a postdoc in the [Molecular AI team](https://github.com/MolecularAI) at AstraZeneca, where I worked on the development of deep generative models for small molecule drug discovery. Before AstraZeneca, I was a PhD student in Professor Berend Smitâ€™s molecular simulation group at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/molsim/) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsmo/). I received my PhD in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in August 2018, and my BS in Chemistry from Caltech in June 2013.

# News
* *24-10-2021* - Check out our most recent [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06389), where we present a generative model for bottom-up synthesis planning and synthesizability-constrained molecular design! The code and data used for this work is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/wenhao-gao/SynNet). 
* *23-09-2021* - I recently presented at the Graph Machine Learning in Industry Workshop hosted by Criteo AI Lab. You can view a recording of the livestreamed talks [here](https://youtu.be/bLN1V5fZD2g) (my talk starts at ~2:41:00).
* *20-09-2021* - I am presenting recent work on deep molecular graph generation at [LatinXChem](https://www.latinxchem.org/) 2021 (all on Twitter)! You can see a high-quality version of my poster [here](https://youtu.be/Qw8nLMJ9Ptg).
* *26-07-2021* - Our MSc student Sara Romeo Atance (Chalmers, Complex Adaptive Systems '21) presented her thesis work on *de novo* molecular design at the ICML RL4RealLife Workshop. Check out our pre-print [here](https://doi.org/10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-9w3tc).
* *01-07-2021* - Our pre-print on graph traversal algorithms for graph-based deep molecular generation is now available on the ChemRxiv [here](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60dc7b3a9986aa5ca753e3a6). Check it out to see how you can use GraphINVENT to generate not only drug-like molecules, but also natural products, and why you should use BFS over DFS.
* *20-05-2021* - Our benchmarking study on chemical space coverage of deep molecular generative models has been accepted in JCIM. Read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01328).
