I am currently a postdoc in the [Coley group](https://coley.mit.edu/) at MIT. Previously, I was a postdoc in the [Molecular AI team](https://github.com/MolecularAI) at AstraZeneca, where I worked on the development of deep generative models for small molecule drug discovery. Before AstraZeneca, I was a PhD student in Professor Berend Smit’s molecular simulation group at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/molsim/) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsmo/). I received my PhD in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in August 2018, and my BS in Chemistry from Caltech in June 2013.

Starting Jan. 2023, I will be joining the faculty in the [Data Science & AI](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/research/dsai/Pages/default.aspx) division at Chalmers as an assistant professor in the Computer Science & Engineering department, where I will be starting the [AI Laboratory for Biomolecular Engineering (AIBE)](https://ailab.bio/). I will be recruiting for various positions in my new group in [Gothenburg](https://www.goteborg.com/en) this coming winter. If you are a student/postdoc interested in doing research at the interface of machine learning and the life sciences in a vibrant and supportive environment, feel free to reach out via email to learn more about upcoming opportunities [in my group](https://ailab.bio/join-us) and [at Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx)!

I can be reached at rociomer [at] mit [dot] edu or rocom [at] chalmers [dot] se.
