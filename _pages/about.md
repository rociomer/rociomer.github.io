![Winter in Poland (2018).](images/about-me-3.jpg)

I am currently a postdoc in the Molecular AI group at AstraZeneca (since October 2018), where I get to play around with deep molecular generative models. Before AstraZeneca, I was a PhD student in Professor Berend Smitâ€™s molecular simulation group at UC Berkeley and EPFL. I received my PhD in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in July 2018, and my BS in Chemistry from Caltech in June 2013.
