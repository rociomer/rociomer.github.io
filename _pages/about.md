I am currently a postdoc in the [Coley group](https://coley.mit.edu/) at MIT. Previously, I was a postdoc in the [Molecular AI team](https://github.com/MolecularAI) at AstraZeneca, where I worked on the development of deep generative models for small molecule drug discovery. Before AstraZeneca, I was a PhD student in Professor Berend Smitâ€™s molecular simulation group at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/molsim/) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsmo/). I received my PhD in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in August 2018, and my BS in Chemistry from Caltech in June 2013.

My research expertise lies in *data-driven molecular design*, at the interface of computer science and chemistry. I am passionate about the development of computational tools which can be used to enhance the process of pharmaceutical drug discovery, such as [deep molecular generative models](https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/abcf91) and [molecular optimization methods](https://doi.org/10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-9w3tc).
