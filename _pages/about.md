![Winter in Poland (2018).](images/about-me-3.jpg)

I am currently a postdoc in the Molecular AI group at AstraZeneca (since October 2018), where I get to play around with deep molecular generative models. Before AstraZeneca, I was a PhD student in Professor Berend Smitâ€™s molecular simulation group at UC Berkeley and EPFL. I received my PhD in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in July 2018, and my BS in Chemistry from Caltech in June 2013.

* *27-11-20:* I recently presented at the 2020 GAIA (Gothenburg AI Alliance) conference. Check out the recorded stream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljhtfrtuNqw&feature=youtu.be)!
* *16-11-20:* New [preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Comparative_Study_of_Deep_Generative_Models_on_Chemical_Space_Coverage/13234289) out where we compare chemical space coverage, including functional group and ring system coverage, in the following deep generative models: CharRNN, REINVENT, AAE, VAE, ORGAN, LatentGAN, and GraphINVENT.
* *08-11-20:* Check out the [guest blog post](http://www.cheminformania.com/using-graphinvent-to-generate-novel-drd2-actives/) I wrote for Cheminformania on using GraphINVENT to generate novel DRD2 actives!
