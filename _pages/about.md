I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Data Science and AI](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/research/dsai/Pages/default.aspx) division at Chalmers in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I head the [AI Laboratory for Biomolecular Engineering (AIBE)](https://ailab.bio/). 

I am recruiting for various positions in my new group in [Gothenburg](https://www.goteborg.com/en). If you are a student/postdoc interested in doing research at the interface of machine learning and the life sciences in a vibrant and supportive environment, feel free to reach out via email to learn more about upcoming opportunities [in my group](https://ailab.bio/join-us) and [at Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx)!

Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Coley group](https://coley.mit.edu/) at MIT, as well as an industrial postdoc in the [Molecular AI team](https://github.com/MolecularAI) at AstraZeneca. Throughout my postdoctoral career, I worked on the development of deep generative models for small molecule drug discovery. Before AstraZeneca, I was a PhD student in Professor Berend Smit’s molecular simulation group at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/molsim/) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsmo/). I received my PhD in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in August 2018, and my BS in Chemistry from Caltech in June 2013.

I am Mexican-American, originally from [Wilmington, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Los_Angeles), but I fell in love with Gothenburg when I moved here for my first postdoc. In my spare time, I enjoy the typical academic hobbies (e.g., hiking, reading, drinking too many cappuccinos) as well as tap dancing, lindy hop, and going for scenic bike rides with friends. I live with my dog, Cloé, and my cat, Harvey.
