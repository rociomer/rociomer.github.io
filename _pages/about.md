I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Data Science and AI](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/research/dsai/Pages/default.aspx) division at Chalmers since January 2023. I head the [AI Laboratory for Molecular Engineering (AIME)](https://ailab.bio/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. If you are a student/postdoc interested in doing research at the interface of machine learning, life science, and materials science in a vibrant and supportive environment, feel free to reach out via email to learn more about upcoming opportunities [in my team](https://ailab.bio/join-us) and [at Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx)!

Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Coley group](https://coley.mit.edu/) at MIT, as well as an industrial postdoc in the [Molecular AI team](https://github.com/MolecularAI) at AstraZeneca. Throughout my postdoctoral career, I worked on the development of Generative AI for small molecule drug discovery. Before AstraZeneca, I was a PhD student in Professor Berend Smit’s molecular simulation group at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/molsim/) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsmo/) where I worked on materials discovery for carbon capture applications. I received my PhD in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in August 2018, and my BS in Chemistry from Caltech in June 2013.

I am Mexican-American, originally from [Wilmington, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Los_Angeles), but I fell in love with Gothenburg when I moved here for my first postdoc!

# News
* *24-04-14* - Save the date for the following two exciting workshops happening in Gothenburg this fall, both of which I am co-organizing:
  * Aug 26-28, 2024 - [Machine Learning for Materials and Molecular Discoveries Symposium (ML2MD)](https://ui.ungpd.com/Events/e2f732ce-74f8-46aa-916e-3307251d42b4)
  * Oct 29-31, 2024 - [CHAIR Structured Learning Workshop](https://ui.ungpd.com/Events/6b0a7d77-0bd4-4bc2-a378-bb6d052d5b08)
* *24-01-29* - Our team at Chalmers is currently recruiting for two positions to join us as part of the Intel-Merck AWASES program. In this project, a PhD student and postdoc will work closely with researchers at Intel and Merck to engineer non-toxic [PFAS](https://research.ibm.com/projects/pfas) replacements using AI. Here is [the link to the PhD advertisement](https://www.chalmers.se/om-chalmers/arbeta-hos-oss/lediga-tjanster/?rmpage=job&rmjob=12530&rmlang=SE), and here is [the link to the postdoc advertisement](https://www.chalmers.se/om-chalmers/arbeta-hos-oss/lediga-tjanster/?rmpage=job&rmjob=12529&rmlang=SE).
* *23-09-12* - Our division is currently recruiting for a position at the assistant professor (FoAss) level at Chalmers. The position is for candidates working in the data-driven life sciences (and related) fields. Consider applying and come be our colleague! [link to job announcement](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/work-with-us/vacancies/?rmpage=job&rmjob=11769&rmlang=UK) (closed)
* *23-08-25* - Our group is currently recruiting two postdocs! For details, check out our [group page](https://ailab.bio/join-us).
* *23-07-10* - Out of office July 11 - August 14. I will be slow in responding to email and prioritize communications from students. Thank you for your patience!
* *23-07-05* - Our [perspective on data sharing in chemistry](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00607) is now published in JCIM! If you're interested in a (brief) history of data sharing in chemistry, and some steps we can take to improve the publication of chemical reaction data, then you're in luck.
* *23-01-09* - First official day as an assistant professor at Chalmers!
* *22-11-07* - Our [group website](https://ailab.bio/) is up and running! Though we are still in the process of updating a few pages, feel free to start browsing our [research interests](https://ailab.bio/research-themes) and [open positions](https://ailab.bio/join-us).
