2015-01-15	The materials genome in action: identifying the performance limits for methane storage	Energy Environ. Sci.	In this Perspective, we have collected and compared on a consistent basis the methane uptake in over 650â€†000 existing and predicted materials using molecular simulations. The results suggest that it may be difficult to reach the (at the time) current Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) target for natural gas storage.	Simon, Cory M. (2015).
