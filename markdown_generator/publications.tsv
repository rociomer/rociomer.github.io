2015-01-15	The materials genome in action: identifying the performance limits for methane storage	Energy Environ. Sci.	In this Perspective, we have collected and compared on a consistent basis the methane uptake in over 650 000 existing and predicted materials using molecular simulations. The results suggest that it may be difficult to reach the (at the time) Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) target for natural gas storage.	Simon, Cory M. et al. (2015).

2015-05-27	What are the best materials to separate a xenon/krypton mixture?	Chem. Mater.	In this work, we screened the Nanoporous Materials Genome, a database of about 670 000 porous material structures, for candidate adsorbents for Xe/Kr separations using a hybrid computational approach combining random forests with molecular simulations. Our study predicts that the two most selective materials in the database are an aluminophosphate zeolite analogue and a calcium-based coordination network, both of which had already been synthesized but (at the time) not yet tested for Xe/Kr separations.

2015-09-27	Systematic tuning and multifunctionalization of covalent organic polymers for enhanced carbon capture	J. Am. Chem. Soc.	Here, we synthesized 17 novel porous covalent organic polymers with a wide range of properties, achieved by tailoring the length and geometry of the building blocks. The multifunctionalization strategy presented can be used in the design of novel catalysts, the synthesis of functional sensors, and the improvement of existing covalent organic polymers.

2016-05-25	Force field development from periodic density functional theory calculations for gas separation applications using metal–organic frameworks	J. Phys. Chem. C	Here, we present accurate force fields developed from density functional theory (DFT) calculations with periodic boundary conditions for use in molecular simulations involving MOF-74 and related frameworks, where conventional force fields fail to accurately model gas adsorption due to the strongly binding open-metal sites. The introduced DFT-derived force fields predict the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CH<sub>4</sub> inside these frameworks much more accurately than other common force fields.

2018-01-04	Unexpected diffusion anisotropy of carbon dioxide in the metal–organic framework Zn<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc)	J. Am. Chem. Soc.	Here, we investigate the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> within the pores of Zn<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc) using pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to observing CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion through the channels parallel to the crystallographic *c*-axis, we unexpectedly find that CO<sub>2</sub> is also able to diffuse between the hexagonal channels in the crystallographic *ab* plane, despite the walls of these channels appearing impermeable in molecular dynamics simulations. This suggests the presence of defects that enable effective multidimensional CO<sub>2</sub> transport in a metal–organic framework with nominally one-dimensional porosity.	Forse, Alexander C. et al. (2018). "Unexpected diffusion anisotropy of carbon dioxide in the metal–organic framework Zn<sub>2</sub>(dobpdc)." <i>J. Am. Chem.

2018-06-21	In silico design of 2D and 3D covalent organic frameworks for methane storage applications	Chem. Mater.	Here, we present a database of 69 840 covalent organic frameworks assembled in silico from 666 distinct organic linkers and four established synthetic routes. Due to their light weights and high internal surface areas, we investigated the frameworks for methane storage applications using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations, and identified 300 promising methane storage materials. To encourage screening studies of these materials for other applications, all structures and their properties were made available on the Materials Cloud.	Mercado, Rocío et al. (2018).

2018-08-28	Generating carbon schwarzites via zeolite-templating	PNAS	Here, we develop a theoretical framework for generating zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) from any zeolite structure, and use our method to generate a library of ZTCs from all known zeolites. We establish criteria for which zeolites can produce experimentally accessible ZTCs and identify over 10 ZTCs that have not (at the time) been synthesized. We go on to establish a relationship between ZTCs and schwarzites using the triply periodic minimal surface describing the ZTC labyrinths.	Braun, Efrem et al. (2018).

2019-04-23	Combined nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics study of methane adsorption in M<sub>2</sub>(dobdc) metal–organic frameworks	J. Phys. Chem. C.	In this work, we examine the diffusion of methane in MOF-74 through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations. At low gas densities, our results suggest that favorable CH<sub>4</sub>–CH<sub>4</sub> interactions lower the free energy barrier for methane hopping between open metal sites, enhancing the translational motion of methane down the *c*-axis. Furthermore, we observe that the self-diffusion coefficient of methane is inversely related to the binding energy at the open metal sites, such that diffusion is most rapid in Zn-MOF-74.
